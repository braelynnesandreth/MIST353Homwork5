## API Information

### Jachob Clark
1. NewPlayerService <br/>
Description: This API will retrive the information of a player by their unique ID. It takes a player's ID as an input, and then provide the information about the player as output. The name is misleading of what it does because I based it off of the entities name and not what it actually did. I was also afraid to change it because of possible errors when redoing the API.

<br/>

2. TeamService <br/>
Description: This API will will give the list of teams that are located in a desired city. The input of this API is the name of a specific city name. The output is a list of teams that are located in desired city of the user. Like my other API, the name is misleading of what it does because I based it off of the entities name and not what it actually did. I was also afraid to change it because of possible errors when redoing the API.
